I'm a PhD student in the [Forests and Global Change lab](https://elsaordway.weebly.com) at UCLA. I use remote sensing to study changes in plant traits over time. I'm interested in the impact of disturbance on ecosystem functioning at three National Ecological Observatory Network sites ([SJER](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/sjer), [SOAP](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/soap), and [TEAK](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/teak)). I use hyperspectral imagery to study the distribution of plant traits at landscape scales. I'm interested in understanding the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem stability.

Prior to joining the Forests and Global Change lab at UCLA, I worked as a high school math and computer science teacher at [The Webb Schools](https://www.webb.org). You can read more about my work in education in the [Teaching tab](https://cderanek.github.io/teaching/).
